May 14 models all good.  Next challenge is to see whether the dicot changes can be minimised by incorporating into the main model.
May15 models see if reduce inhibition by s_petmargin but didn't work so reverted.  Grows ok up to 1.55, then base has problem.  
Maybe try using a thick base next time instead - would need to ask Richard.
May16 try seeing if we can release constraint on overlap but make base thicker. Note that base currently can't grow in thickness because of anchoring.  
Maybe fix only the minimum nodes - ask Richard
Equalising growth in base kper with petiole looked good but too much growth at rim of tube.  Try inhibiting kpar with id lateral.  This opens the leaf.
save as new project 16aMay and introduce final stage again.
Works quite well but still difficult to open at the end.  Save as new project 16b, remove inhibtion within petiole.  Open slightly with kper during late.
fix nodes only on B side and savc as 17 May.
Save version from 17 May as 18 May, introduce subdivision of petmargin for benefit of ns mutant.
managed to open leaf later by inhibiting margin kpar.  now try switching later.
18aMay looked good but need to fix region of petiole with inhibited growth and reduce promotion of kper
20May overgrowth of base, so edit it by extending overlap to more than a few nodes and reducing growth rates during late.
20May very good though too much repression of petiole margin.
21bMay very good until about 1.5. Maybe try increasing kpar generally using 2*grobase or 1.5*grobase and then reduce timestep to make it look better?
Also what happens if you increase duration of middle phase to 2.5?
21bMay very good. Now extending middle phase past 1.2 and inhibiting base with nsheath.
22May very good - try improving base and promote petiole
22aMay remove b side restriction from bottom and promote petiole more.  Looks very good but sheath still pokes out.  Try anchoring base not bottom
24 May very good, though blade grows through petiole at bottom.  Save as 24aMay and create s_nsheath to promote base growth and reinstate weak inhibition of smargin middle phase.
24bMay same as 24 May but with s_nsheath and wider sector.
24bMay introduced pgrad control of kpar. Very good by 1.35 then overbends.
25May try introducing pgrad control of kper. No good.  Instead managed to open after extension for first time!  Petiole growth too much so revisit.
25bMay try alternating growth repression to open blade at end.  Looks good at 1.42 Still can't get decent opened blade but at least the blade separates.
26bMayNew version with adjustments for ns mutant. NOte still can't open at 1.35.  Go back and incorporate NS mutant changes - 26cMay
27May Went back to 24bMay out of desperation!  Need to correct the kpar in the nsheath mutant but otherwise try this again.
First step - try increasing Kpar growth rate during late phase. No longer works.  So try introducing late phase at time 1.3
27 May looks ok at 1.35.  Problem is nsheath mutant.  
So go back to basics with 27Maynsheath to sort this out: 
introduce S-minus to inhib growth, 
reintroduce petmargin to promote base, 
clamp smid at petmargin, 
remover kper from intial phase
Note that final version ran well but too much infolding so next will reduce kpar differential on margin - do this for 27aMayGrassleaf.
27aMayGrassleaf looks good.  Note that now petiole boundary is above the rim of the initial disc.
10thJuneDicot looks good but boundary not smooth.  Next try subdividing margin in 10aJune.
Same as 30 May but change early growth so no longer involves petmargin inhibition and increase kper to create more overlap.
28 May try inhibiting par growth in middle phase in margin. 
27bMay remove inhib by of Kpar by id_petmargin and increase inhibition of kper at top and bottom. 
29b main change was to inhibit kper by sminus during early, to prevent curving over,.  Now need to reduce inhib of kper by smid in mid phase.
29d narrowsheath mutant same as 29b run to time 1.5.  Looks very good but when I run wt on my laptop it doesn't look good.  So rerun on my PC as 30May.   
30aMay has all problems fixed and looks very good - 2mm long at time 1.5.  Now try narrowsheath mutant.
30aMay narrowsheath looks good too!  
30bMay try introducing a period of extension and shifting the other periods later - seemed ok for nsheathmutant
30cMay try 30bMay but for wt.  Looks fantastic!
30dMay same as 30cMay but increase period of extension.
31May same as 30cMay but reduce repression by petmargin in nsheathmutant.  No good - causes it to crumple.  So go back to original version and make a movie.
31aMay try to improve nsheath.  Increase Gthresh to 0.4, increase duration of extension phase (with increased inhibition of margin).
1bJune same as 31aMay but now try dicot.  For dicot need to reduce inhibition of kpar and promotion of kper at margins
1bJune dicot looks good upto time 0.8.  Save as 1cJune to check wt grass still runs ok. Managed to sort out tip!
2June Grassleaf same as 1cJune but try to remove bulge at the tip.
4aJuneNarrowsheath same as 2 June but narrowsheath to check ok.
8th June based on 5th June Good.
Based on 10th June dicot which is very good.
Based on 11th June dicot which is very good and wider leaf.  Try to improve segmentation.
12th June wox changed three things: 1. promotion of kpar in margin at early stage, 2, reduce kpar inhib by id petmargin in early phase
3. inhibition by dicot in setting petiole domain.  Looks good. Now check dicot still works.

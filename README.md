This is a set of computational models associated with the paper "Evolution of the grass leaf by primordium extension and
petiole-lamina remodeling", by Richardson et al., to appear in Science, 2021.

The models are:

GPT\_Tissue\_sheet\_models\_of\_further\_leaf\_development\_20211006   
GPT\_Volumetric\_models\_of\_leaf\_primordium\_emergence\_20211006

The models can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires an installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
